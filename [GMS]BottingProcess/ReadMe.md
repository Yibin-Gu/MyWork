# [GMS]BottingProcess

In this folder is my attempt to automate the operation of the **MapleStory[Global.ver]**(GMS)

> **Notice that**: This project was created solely for research and learning purposes. The usage of this project for malicious purposes in-game is against Nexon's terms of service and, thus, *discouraged*.

## Introduction
Arrding to [Wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapleStory>), **MapleStory** is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game, developed by South Korean company Wizet. Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, and each is published by various companies such as Nexon.

**Why GMS?** 

**MapleStory** global version is using DirectX mode in window framing, which means if the game is running in this window mode, it cannot(or they did not do it) block the virtual input based on DX mode. According to this fact, we could use some programs that simulates key/mouse input into the game window. 

## What tool I use?
QMacro is the tool that is a simulation of mouse keyboard action software. By making a script, you can make the program instead of your hands to automatically execute a series of mouse and keyboard actions. This tool use their own coding language based on **VB**.

>**Note that**: This is a Chinese language based tool and for more information can be found here: [QMacro Desprition(in Chinese)](<https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%8C%89%E9%94%AE%E7%B2%BE%E7%81%B5>)

The advantage of using this software is that it is free, convenient and can consult a lot of materials. Moreover, since this software has been used by the public for nearly 10 years, the development and use of plug-ins are very mature.
