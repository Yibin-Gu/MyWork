# Project Intro
>The goal of this project is to design a 4-bit “Absolute-value Detector” with the minimum energy
and worst-case delay of 800ps. Here “delay” refers to the worst-case propagation delay and
“energy” refers to total energy drawn from V DD for a given input probability distribution. You may
use gate sizing and supply voltage scaling as variables. No registers (i.e. pipelining) are allowed.

This project was made during UCLA EE115C course and this folder includes all files that I used/created in **Cadence**
